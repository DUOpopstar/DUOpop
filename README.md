Package Installation:

1.  Ensure you are in a 'clean' R environment, with no loaded data objects or packages, to avoid issues with updating existing packages.

    -   Close all RStudio windows until only one is open.

    -   In RStudio, go to the **Tools** menu \> **Global Options** \> uncheck "**restore .RData into workspace at startup**" \> **OK**.

2.  In RStudio, go to the **Session** menu, select **Terminate R**, and then execute the following commands in the R console:

`> install.packages('remotes')`

`> remotes::install_local("I:/Team Data-Science/Synthetische Data/R package/DUOpop_0.9.1.tar.gz", upgrade = F)`

\title{Select Number of Principal Components}
\usage{
number_of_principal_components(sdev)
}
\arguments{
\item{sdev}{a numeric vector of standard deviations of the principal components.}
}
\value{
An integer: the number of principal components required to explain at least 95\% of the variance.
}
\description{
Determines the number of principal components needed to retain at least 95\% of the total variance
in a PCA result. This is used to reduce dimensionality while preserving most of the information.
}
\details{
This funcion accumulates the explained variance and selects the minimum number of components
whose cumulative variance exceeds or equals 95\% of the total.

Called by \code{\link{get_encoding}} to decide how many components to retain from \code{\link{pca_encode}}.
